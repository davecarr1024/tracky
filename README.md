# tracky

**tracky** is a grid-based toy train simulator in Python. Inspired by wooden train sets, it models trains moving along interconnected track pieces with simple physics and coupling dynamics. The goal is to build a clean, extensible simulation engine with an optional visual frontend.

## Features

- Grid-aligned track pieces (straight, corners, switches, etc.)
- Cars with velocity, mass, and spring-like coupling
- Trains that move under their own power or get pushed/pulled
- Easily extendable track logic (switches, dead ends, loops)
- Pygame visualizer
